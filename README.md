# Data anlysis for manuscript titled "Island plant species distributions contracted at the cooler edge compared to mainland"

## Project Description
The scripts and csv files document the process of: 

downloading occurrence data, cleaning and combining with the A-Island dataset for analysis. These include the scripts numbered 1-5

the process of comparing islands at the cool edge of species enveleopes with remaining islands within species envelopes and modelling the paprameters most predictive of occurrence on islands. These scripts are labelled "a", "b" and "c".

The data processing included occurrence data files (stored in .rds format) and Global CLimate Model files (stored in .tif format) that were too large to upload here, but are available at the following FigShare repository: https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/236195, titled "island-plant-temperature-envelopes".
